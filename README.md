# hey, I’m Abhimanyu 👋

i build things — sometimes it’s ai agents, sometimes automation workflows, sometimes just tools i wish existed.

currently a final-year ece student who took a sharp turn into cs — now deep into ml, nlp, backend apis, and ai agents.

i’ve interned as an ai engineer & software dev, working on multimodal RAG, langchain agents, saas tools, and evaluation frameworks — mostly using streamlit, fastapi, huggingface, and python.

what started with curiosity became a habit — i try, i break, i learn, i repeat.
