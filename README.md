# hey, Iâ€™m Abhimanyu.

i build things â€” sometimes itâ€™s ai agents, sometimes itâ€™s automation workflows, sometimes just tools i wish existed.  
right now, iâ€™m a final-year ece student who went rogue into cs â€” deep into machine learning, nlp, backend apis, and more recently, ai agents and automation systems.

iâ€™ve interned as an ai engineer and software dev, working on multimodal rag, langchain agents, saas tools, evaluation frameworks, and workflows with streamlit, fastapi, and huggingface.  
what started with curiosity became a habit â€” i try, i break, i learn, i repeat.

## outside the code

i freelance sometimes to pay rent â€” mostly ui/ux and graphic design.  
i enjoy thinking through systems, writing when i feel something, and staying caffeinated through all of it.  
won a few ui competitions. led a gdg chapter. pitched in hackathons.  
i like dreaming big and building quiet. that's the vibe.
